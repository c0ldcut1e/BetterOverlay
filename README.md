# WUPSBetterOverlay
A simple plugin I made for rendering overlays on the screen using GX2.
This plugin might not work and might not be very optimized due to it just being a test.
A lot of this stuff was taken from [here](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/imgui_overlay_plugin), from which I also optimized the ImGui backend.

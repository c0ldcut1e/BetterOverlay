# BetterOverlay
A simple plugin I made for rendering overlays on the screen using GX2 and ImGui.
This is basically the [imgui_overlay_plugin](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/imgui_overlay_plugin) but more optimized and with more support.
## Dependencies
- [wut](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut)
- [WiiUPluginSystem](https://github.com/wiiu-env/WiiUPluginSystem)
- [libmappedmemory](https://github.com/wiiu-env/libmappedmemory)
## How to build
Simply run `make` to compile and `make clean` to clean.
## Credits
- [GaryOderNichts](https://github.com/garyodernichts) for the [imgui_overlay_plugin](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/imgui_overlay_plugin) from which I took a lot of stuff from, without this I couldn't have made this.
